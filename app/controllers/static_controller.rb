    @about_me_blurb = "Hi Iâ€™m Patrick, and I build stuff for the internet. I realized at a young age that what I love above all else is learning, discovering new concepts and solving problems. I love to learn new things and try to experience as much as I possibly can. Right now I am learning rails, and loving it, and more than that I am trying to learn the core software engineering concepts behind rails to really grasp how it works. I have a very varied background, I studied political science at Concordia university in Montreal, and I ran a residential paint contracting company west of the Montreal area of 2 years. I think my unique combination of skills and experiences gives me a different view on the development process. When managing my painting company I was in charge of all marketing, selling and producing of the work, including hiring and managing a staff of painters. I understand how to take initiative and lead others to achieve their goals. Studying political science has helped me to understand how the world works on a deeper level. The combination of these experiences and others along with my development skills are what I think make me an awesome developer. I am always excited to learn new skills and always looking for the next awesome opportunity and to work on projects I can be passionate about and add value too."
